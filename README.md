### How to play the game

The original game rules have undergone many changes through time, so here's the rules we are following in our game:
1. Game is played typically on square sized grids, ranging from 6x6 to 18x18.
2. We have 4 kinds of sea ships: Battleship, Cruiser, Destroyer, Submarine.
3. Players take turns and set up their ships on the grid.
4. After board is set up, the opposing player makes guesses about possible location coordinates of ships, one pair of coordinates at a time.
5. If the player makes a correct guess, he is informed about the hit and the other player marks the coordinate as "hit". 
6. The player who guesses all ship coordinates first wins the "war" and is hence declared the winner.
